### Breaking

- Upgrading `vue-style-loader` to 3.0 introduces a small breaking change: the CSS contained in a `*.vue` component will now be lazy-injected, when the component is rendered for the first time. (Previously the style is injected as soon as the component is imported.)

### New

- Compatibility for the new features in `vue-server-renderer@^2.3.0`.

- `extractCSS` option: simple configuration for CSS extraction. [docs](http://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/options.html#extractcss)

- The loader now automatically infers `sass-loader?indentedSyntax` when using `<style lang="sass">` , and infers `sass-loader` when using `<style lang="scss">`.

### Fixed

- #757 bring back webpack context for `postcss.config.js`
